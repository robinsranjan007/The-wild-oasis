🌿 The Wild Oasis

A modern React project built as part of The Ultimate React Course (Udemy) to master React Router 6.4+ and modern React app architecture.

🚀 Overview

The Wild Oasis is a hotel management web app that demonstrates real-world concepts such as:

Nested and protected routes using React Router 6.4+

Data loading with loaders and actions (no full-page reloads)

State management with Context API and custom hooks

Styled Components for reusable, theme-based UI

Modular folder structure for scalable React apps

🧠 Learning Journey

This project helped me deeply understand how modern React apps handle navigation, async data fetching, authentication, and component-based UI design. It was a hands-on way to connect theory with professional-grade project structure.
